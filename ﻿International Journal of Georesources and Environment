I am new at this so I may be making a mistake or inadvertently violating a rule. My purpose is to suggest that this publisher/journal "International Journal of Georesources and Environment" be looked at as either predatory or "crap". I see some differences between the predatory, who are, crooks and cons, and the merely inept. Though the line is fine. Its email is "ijge@camdemia.ca"; it's website is "http://ijg.camdemia.ca/". I don't know the next step. If I've stepped over a line let me know. Cheers. SteveLaudig@gmail.com 18 Jul 2018
